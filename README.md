# 👋 I'm Pietro Putelli

I’m Pietro Putelli, I’m a creative and young person, who loves to share and discuss several topics with others and always learn new things.

Currently I'm looking for a job opportunity as fullstack junior developer since I'd really like to work in a team to improve my skills and start my professional career.

I dedicated myself to build things through coding, as I think it's the best way to express my creativity.
For the past year I've been working on a personal project, named **Real** that has been a great challenge for me from the tech and product point of view.

### The Real project

Real is a mobile app, developed using React Native, that allow users to meet people, found venues and events nearby.
The Real backend is written in Python, using the Django framework.
