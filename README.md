# 👋 I'm Pietro Putelli

I’m Pietro Putelli, I’m a creative and young person, who loves to share and discuss several topics with others and always learn new things.

Currently I'm looking for a job opportunity as fullstack junior developer since I'd really like to work in a team to improve my skills and start my professional career.

I dedicated myself to build things through coding, as I think it's the best way to express my creativity.
For the past year I've been working on a personal project, named **Weav** that has been a great challenge for me from the tech and product point of view.

### The Weav project

Weav is a mobile application, available both on iOS and Android, that allows users to interact and meet new people, find venues and events in the city or nearby. From a technical point of view the app is developed using React Native for the frontend and Django Framework for the Backend, then set up the Linux Server with Nginx.

On the other hand I spent lots of time on developing the conceptual model behind the product and now I’m talking with businesses in my city and try to launch the app.
