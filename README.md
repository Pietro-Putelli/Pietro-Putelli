I’m Pietro Putelli, I’m 20 and I live in Italy.

I’m a creative and ambitious person, who loves to be interested in the most disparate topics and the amazing conversations with other people, being able to clash, share and always learn new things.

I love reading about everything and 
I’m way into product design and programming, for this reason I dedicated to design and develop a mobile app, named REAL.

Currently I’m working to compete the app and I’m learning Python for the Web 3.0, since my aim is to found a job opportunity abroad, in an environment that allows me to meet new people, and improve myself.
